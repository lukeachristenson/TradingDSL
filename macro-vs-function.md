# Macro vs. Function Implementation Comparison

## Implementation Approaches

Our Trading DSL has been implemented using two different approaches:

1. **Macro-based Implementation** (`trading-dsl.rkt`): Uses Racket's macro system and syntax-spec to provide compile-time validation and a specialized syntax.

2. **Function-based Implementation** (`function-dsl.rkt`): Uses regular Racket functions with optional keyword arguments to provide similar functionality.

## Key Differences

### 1. Error Checking

- **Macro-based**: Performs validation at compile time. Errors are caught before the program runs.
- **Function-based**: Performs validation at runtime. Errors are caught when the function is executed.

### 2. Syntax

- **Macro-based**: Custom syntax with definition forms like `define/strategy` and `define/combined-strategy`, whih allow us to ensure only strategies can be used in certain places (such as when backtesting)
- **Function-based**: Standard Racket function calls with keyword arguments. 

### 3. Representation

- **Macro-based**: Uses a symbol table at compile time to track strategy periods.
- **Function-based**: Uses a runtime struct (`strategy-spec`) to encapsulate both the strategy function and its date range.

## Code Example Comparison

### Strategy Definition

**Macro-based:**
```racket
(define/strategy annual-momentum (top-performer #:period 1y)
  #:from "2024-01-05"
  #:to "2024-06-05")
```

**Function-based:**
```racket
(define annual-momentum 
  (strategy (top-performer #:period 1y)
            #:from "2024-01-05"
            #:to "2024-06-05"))
```

### Strategy Composition

**Macro-based:**
```racket
(define/combined-strategy seasonal-strategy
  annual-momentum      
  biannual-momentum    
  #:mid "2024-06-03")
```

**Function-based:**
```racket
(define seasonal-strategy
  (combined-strategy annual-momentum
                     biannual-momentum
                     #:mid "2024-06-03"))
```

## Tradeoffs

### Advantages of Macro-based Approach

1. **Early Validation**: Detects errors at compile time rather than runtime.
2. **Custom Syntax**: Provides a more domain-specific feel to the language.

### Advantages of Function-based Approach

1. **First-class Values**: Strategies are regular values that can be passed to functions and manipulated.
2. **Simpler Implementation**: Easier to understand and extend without macro expertise.
3. **Language Portability**: The function-based approach can be more easily ported to languages without macro systems.

## Conclusion

The macro-based approach offers stronger guarantees through compile-time checking and a more domain-specific feel, while the function-based approach offers a simpler implementation with almost the same functionality. 

For our Trading DSL, having both implementations provided us valuable insights into language design tradeoffs.
